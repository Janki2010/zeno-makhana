                    I am Richa, an Indian mother and a successful corporate leader. At 40, with two decades of experience navigating the complex world of the global food industry, I am a force to be reckoned with. But whenever I visit superstores, I was missing out the healthy snack options and the racks were full of unhealthy snack options. I was driven by a deep desire to offer something healthy and wholesome to children and the world.

                  <p className="text-base text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    I had spent my career developing products for multinational corporations, but something was always missing. The products were often filled with preservatives and artificial flavors, a stark contrast to the pure, simple food I grew up with. This realization hit me hard when I saw my own child reaching for packaged snacks instead of the nutritious snacks she packed. That's when the idea for "Zeno" was born.

                    I knew the power of makhana, or fox nuts‚Äîa superfood from India, packed with nutrients and naturally light. But I also knew that to make it a global success, I had to make it exciting. For months, my kitchen became my lab. I experimented with flavors inspired by my travels: cheddar cheese from a business trip to France, sweet chili from a family holiday in Mexico, and a cream and onion flavor from eastern Europe, and finally the Himalayan salt and pepper blend that reminds me of my origin.

                    This journey wasn't just about launching a brand; it was about connecting my roots to my modern life. I saw a gap in the market for snacks that were both healthy and flavorful, and I was the perfect person to fill it. My 20 years of experience gave me the business acumen, and my maternal instincts gave me the passion. I am not just selling a product; I am sharing a piece of my heritage, a mother's promise of good health and great taste, one delicious makhana at a time.<span className="text-2xl text-primary font-serif">"</span>
